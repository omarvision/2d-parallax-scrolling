# 2d-parallax-scrolling
Parallax Scrolling is when multiple backgrounds are scrolling. THe backgrounds further in the distance scroll slower and the backgrounds drawn more to the front scroll faster.  It gives the illusion of depth. It is similar to when you look out the side car window and things closer move faster while things farther appear to move slower.
